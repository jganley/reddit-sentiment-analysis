### Reddit Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to analyze reddit posts from the /r/nfl subreddit, specifically from the Super Bowl LII Game Threads. This idea is to use sentiment analysis techniques to see how reddit users as a whole felt during each moment of the game, and to see if we can find any correlations between good plays for a particular team and the overall sentiment of the reddit users.
